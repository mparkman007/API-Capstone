This is a capstone project to create a website tht utilizes a public API. Once downloaded and opened you'll need to run "npm i" to install all the node modules to get the project working. 
You should be able to enter (mostly) any stock traded into the search bar, and be taken to a profile page that will provide 
you with information regarding the stock as well as an embedded widget from Trading Views that will display a chart for the requested stock.

Please be aware that the API key available to use in this project is only a "free" version and as such has a limited number of calls per day (I believe 200). 
This is a student project so please be aware there may be a few minor bugs I haven't caught but otherwise satisfies and exceeds the requested parameters of the project!
